CRYPTS is a real estate company looking to predict house prices for different regions in the USA. They provided a dataset for this task, and you have decided to use a Linear Regression model to estimate the selling price of houses. To address potential overfitting in Linear Regression, you will employ L2 Regularization and perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model.
Jupyter Notebook is also attached which contains visualization and plots of features.

The Linear Regression model is deployed using streamlit.The Web page is basically the landing page to the streamlit application.

Dataset contains 7 columns and 5000 rows with CSV extension. The data contains the following columns :

- 'Avg. Area Income': Avg. Income of householder of the city house is located in.
- 'Avg. Area House Age': Avg. Age of Houses in same city.
- 'Avg. Area Number of Rooms': Avg. Number of Rooms for Houses in same city.
- 'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms': Avg. Number of Bedrooms for Houses in same city.
- 'Area Population': Population of city.
- 'Price': Price that the house sold at.
- 'Address': Address of the houses.
